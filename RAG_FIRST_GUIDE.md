### Enabling Hybrid Mode (Optional)

1. **Load Documents** (as above)

2. **Check the Box**
   - Sidebar → "☑️ Allow LLM General Knowledge"

3. **Ask Enhanced Questions**
   - "What does the document say and how does this compare to standard practice?"
   - "Explain the concept mentioned in the document"

4. **Get Hybrid Answers**
   - Document content clearly marked
   - General knowledge clearly marked
   - Both sources distinguished

### Using LLM Mode (No Documents)

1. **Don't Upload Documents** (or clear them)

## The Checkbox Explained

### "Allow LLM General Knowledge" Checkbox

**Location**: Sidebar, under "Answer Source"

**Default State**: UNCHECKED (disabled)

**Purpose**: Controls whether AI can use general knowledge

**States**:

| Documents | Checkbox | Result |
|-----------|----------|--------|
| Loaded | ☐ Unchecked | STRICT RAG - document only |
| Loaded | ☑ Checked | HYBRID - documents + knowledge |
| Not loaded | N/A | LLM MODE - knowledge only |

**Important**: When no documents are uploaded, the checkbox is not shown (LLM mode is automatic).

## Benefits of RAG-First Design

### ✅ Eliminates Confusion
**Before**: "Is it using my document or its knowledge?"  
**After**: Clear mode indicators show exactly what's happening

### ✅ Guarantees Document Fidelity
**Before**: AI mixed sources unpredictably  
**After**: In RAG mode, ONLY document content used

### ✅ User Control
**Before**: Couldn't control when AI used general knowledge  
**After**: Explicit checkbox gives you full control

### ✅ No Hallucinations in RAG Mode
**Before**: AI might make up details  
**After**: In RAG mode, everything must be from document

### ✅ Clear Error Messages
**Before**: Vague "I don't know" responses  
**After**: "This information is not found in the provided document"

## Example Interactions

### Example 1: Strict RAG Mode

**Setup**:
- Uploaded research paper
- Checkbox UNCHECKED

**Question**: "What was the sample size?"

**Response**:
```
According to the Methods section on page 4, the study included 
150 participants. The document states: "A total of 150 adult 
volunteers (ages 18-65) were recruited through online advertisements 
between January and March 2023."
```

**What you get**: Direct answer from document with citation and quote.

### Example 2: Strict RAG - Missing Info

**Setup**:
- Uploaded research paper
- Checkbox UNCHECKED

**Question**: "What statistical software did they use?"

**Response**:
```
This information is not found in the provided document. The Methods 
section describes the statistical analyses performed but does not 
specify which software package was used.
```

**What you get**: Honest acknowledgment that info is missing.

### Example 3: Hybrid Mode

**Setup**:
- Uploaded research paper
- Checkbox CHECKED ✅

**Question**: "What is the methodology and how does it compare to standard approaches?"

**Response**:
```
FROM THE DOCUMENT:
The document describes using a randomized controlled trial with 
pre-test/post-test design. Specifically: "Participants were randomly 
assigned to treatment or control groups, with measurements taken at 
baseline and after 8 weeks."

FROM GENERAL KNOWLEDGE:
This is a strong methodological approach. RCTs are considered the gold 
standard for causal inference because randomization helps control for 
confounding variables. The pre-test/post-test design allows within-subject 
comparisons, increasing statistical power.
```

**What you get**: Both document content AND broader context, clearly labeled.

### Example 4: LLM Mode

**Setup**:
- No documents uploaded

**Question**: "What is a t-test?"

**Response**:
```
A t-test is a statistical test used to compare the means of two groups 
to determine if they are significantly different from each other. It's 
commonly used when you have a small sample size (typically n < 30) and 
assumes the data follows a normal distribution...
```

**What you get**: Standard LLM explanation using general knowledge.

## Template System

### Empty by Default

**Philosophy**: You know what questions you need to ask!

**Current state**: No pre-built templates

**Your role**: Create templates that match YOUR workflow

### Creating Templates

1. **Navigate** to "Manage Templates" page
2. **Click** "➕ Add Template" tab
3. **Fill in**:
   - **Name**: "Analyze Methodology"
   - **Category**: "Research" (or create your own)
   - **Template Text**: "Analyze the research methodology described in this document"
   - **Requires Input**: Check if you want user to provide content
   - **Description**: "Analyzes research methods section"
4. **Click** "Add Template"

### Template Best Practices

**For RAG-first usage**, templates should be document-focused:

✅ **Good RAG Templates**:
- "Summarize the key findings from this document"
- "Extract all statistical results mentioned"
- "List limitations acknowledged in the document"
- "Compare methodologies across these documents"

❌ **Not ideal for RAG**:
- "Explain the concept of X" (no document needed)
- "What are best practices for Y?" (general question)

### Suggested Template Categories

Based on RAG-first philosophy:

1. **Document Analysis**
   - Summarize document
   - Extract key points
   - Identify limitations

2. **Research Review**
   - Analyze methodology
   - Evaluate findings
   - Compare studies

3. **Data Extraction**
   - Extract statistics
   - List participants details
   - Find specific information

4. **Synthesis**
   - Compare documents
   - Identify themes
   - Find contradictions

## Troubleshooting

### "No documents uploaded!" error

**Problem**: Trying to ask question in RAG mode without documents

**Solutions**:
1. Upload documents first, OR
2. Check "Allow LLM General Knowledge" to use LLM mode

### AI still seems to use general knowledge (RAG mode)

**Verify**:
1. Green banner shows "✅ STRICT RAG MODE"?
2. Sidebar shows "✅ AI will answer ONLY from documents"?
3. Checkbox is UNCHECKED?

**If all yes and still happening**:
- Lower temperature to 0.1-0.2 in sidebar
- Try with a more explicit question
- Check what text was extracted (preview mode)

### Want to use both document and knowledge

**Solution**: Check the "Allow LLM General Knowledge" box

**Result**: Hybrid mode activated

### Template doesn't work as expected

**Remember**: Templates work in whatever mode you're in
- RAG mode → template gets document-only answer
- Hybrid mode → template gets hybrid answer
- LLM mode → template gets general answer

## Advanced Usage

### Document Management

**Keep Documents Loaded**: Documents stay loaded across questions
- Ask multiple questions about same document
- No need to re-upload

**Clear Documents**: Click "🗑️ Clear All Documents"
- Switches to LLM mode
- Useful when done with document analysis

**Multiple Documents**: Upload several at once

**Hybrid → RAG**: Uncheck the box
- Returns to strict document-only mode
- Great for verification

**RAG/Hybrid → LLM**: Clear documents
- Switches to general knowledge mode
- Use for non-document questions
